# JoyCon-Driver
A vJoy feeder / Driver for the Nintendo Switch JoyCons and Pro Controller on Windows with analog stick support and motion controls

## How to use
1. Install vJoy, found here: http://vjoystick.sourceforge.net/site/

2. Setup your vJoy Devices to look like this:

    * If you have more than 2 JoyCons, or have a Pro Controller, enable an additional device for each that you have

3. Pair the JoyCon(s) / Pro Controller to your PC

4. Run the Application, if it doesn't detect your JoyCon(s) / Pro Controller, make sure they are fully paired/connected and restart the program.
	* For the latest features and updates, clone the repositiory / download the zip

5. Once the program is running vJoy should register the input from the JoyCon(s) / Pro Controller.
    * To verify it's working you can use the vJoy monitor that comes with vJoy, it looks like this: http://i.imgur.com/x4Fn7Cq.png
    * To re-pair the JoyCon(s) / Pro Controller go into Settings and remove them and then pair them again.
    * You'll likely want to use this with something like x360ce (http://www.x360ce.com), which will let you map the vJoy device to a virtual xbox controller for games that support them.


## Important Notes
* The JoyCons need to be re-paired anytime after they've reconnected to the switch.
